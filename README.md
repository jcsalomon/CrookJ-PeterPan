# John Crook’s (1852–1922) Music to “Peter Pan, or, The Boy who wouldn’t Grow Up.”

This project is dedicated to my son Martin:  
May his dreams be always bright.

## About this Project

This is a re-release of the incidental music
originally published under the title
_The Music to J.M. Barrie’s Successful Play “Peter Pan.” or, The Boy who wouldn’t Grow Up._
I know of two published versions of the score.
The first can be found on the U.R. Research site
at <http://hdl.handle.net/1802/24425>,
and is a scan of the 1905 W. Paxton & Co. printing,
[OCLC 21828857](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21828857),
with 70 pages of piano music.
The second can be found on Google Books
at <https://books.google.com/books?id=J-wQAAAAYAAJ>,
and is a scan of the Price & Reynolds / Jos. W. Stern & Co. printing,
[OCLC 903862906](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903862906),
from the Harvard College Music Library collection,
with only 40 pages of music.
The incidental music to the deleted scene
“The arrival of the beautiful mothers”,
as found in the 40-page editions,
has in the longer version been renamed “Ent’racte” (_sic_).

(There’s also [OCLC 221973102](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/221973102),
70 pages long and publisher listed as Price & Reynolds.
Whether this is a different version or a catalog error I do not know.)

This project is typeset
using the LilyPond typesetting system,
and intended for eventual inclusion in the Mutopia Project:
<http://www.mutopiaproject.org/>
or on GitHub at <https://github.com/MutopiaProject/MutopiaProject>.

## Other Versions of the Score

I have been told (on the LilyPond users mailing list)
that this score has the characteristics of a piano reduction.
The Theatre Communications Group’s _American Theater_, volume 20 (2003)
makes passing mention of an 80-page version of this score
which “contained much intrumen[tation]”.
I have not found any other reference to such an instrumental score;
any information on the subject would be much appreciated.

There was apparently a defined “Peter Pan: Selections” published somehow,
(possibly the source for the recordings mentioned below but that’s just a guess).
The National Library of Australia has a version in its Flynn collection,
<http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4086045>,
[OCLC 225705957](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225705957);
the University of Pittsburgh Music Library has a version in the Mirskey collection,
<http://pittcat.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=4855755>,
[OCLC 156956598](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156956598);
see also [OCLC 144569049](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144569049)
and the British Library’s <http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?doc=BLL01004288305>,
[OCLC 497759088](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/497759088).

The NLA’s “J.C. Williamson collection of performance materials”
also has “unpublished and manuscript materials”
at <http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3293635>,
[OCLC 224405859](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/224405859),
including several folders of music.
Some of this music is from other versions of the play,
but possibly some is fuller versions of John Crook’s score.
Further information would be very welcome.

## Recordings

There have been very few recordings of this music.

In 1929 the J.H. Squire Celeste Octet recorded “selections”,
released by Columbia Gramophone as a two-sided 12″ 78 RPM disk,
catalog number 9768.

In 1940,
in the second year of the London Blitz preventing performances of the play,
there was something of a cast recording made,
with Jean Forbes-Robertson as Peter,
Dinah Sheridan as Wendy,
and Gordon Harker as Captain Hook;
the orchestra was conducted by Clifford Greenwood.
This was released as His Master’s Voice #9119.

Sepia Records [#1037](http://sepiarecords.com/sepia1037.html),
“100 Years of Peter Pan”,
includes both those recordings.

There is also His Master’s Voice #2693,
another set of “selections”
performed by the London Palladium Orchestra
under the direction of Richard Crean,
also released as a two-sided 12″ 78 RPM disk,
but which was not included on the Sepia Records CD.

(Thank you to Bruce Hanson,
author of _Peter Pan on Stage and Screen, 1904–2010_,
for the above information.)

There seems also to have been another release by The Gramophone Company
of “selections”
performed by the Mayfair Orchestra
under the direction of G[eorge] W. Byng;
see [OCLC 78037569](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/78037569)
and [OCLC 82063754](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/82063754)
for all the information I’ve found about this recording.

More recently,
for Christmas 1986
Glyn Dearman produced for the BBC
a [radio-play version of _Peter Pan_](http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/16029f18d878499a9b27b5f21ae8af8c),
later in 1989
(or 1992? online information is inconsistent)
released as an audio recording:
[OCLC 472769196](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/472769196) or
[OCLC 32502966](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32502966).
This 2 cassette recording, released together with a book,
[OCLC 655603058](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/655603058),
was subtitled, “The Original Play and Music”.
Alec McCowen narrated (as J.M. Barrie),
with Robert Lang as Mr. Darling & Capt. Hook,
Joanna David as Mrs. Darling,
Lucinda Bateson as Wendy,
and Graham McGrath as Peter Pan.
John Crook’s music was performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra
under the direction of Chris Walker.
This is a fairly straight adaptation of the script to radio-play format,
and the music is beautifully arranged
though of course it’s abridged so the dialog can be clearly heard.

Similar to the Sepia Records collection,
Delos Music released [DE3201](https://delosmusic.com/recording/an-awfully-big-adventure-the-best-of-peter-pan/),
“An Awfully Big Adventure: The Best of Peter Pan (1904–1996)”.
Three tracks are of John Crook’s music,
all of them new arrangements:
“The Arrival of Wendy”,
“The Song of the Pirates”,
and “The Fight and Overthrow of the Pirates”.

## A Note on Copyright

The copyright status of _Peter Pan_ is somewhat odd;
see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy#Copyright_status>.
In particular, note that performance of the story within the U.K.
requires payment of royalties to the Great Ormond Street Hospital
as a continuation of J.M. Barrie’s 1929 gift of the copyright to GOSH.

I have confirmed with GOSH that John Crook’s score
was never included in this gift
(the copyright would have belonged not to Mr. Barrie
but to Mr. Crook or perhaps the Duke of York’s Theatre).
Since John Crook died in 1922,
the score is out of copyright at least in the U.S.A. and E.U.
