# The Music to J.M. Barrie’s Successful Play “Peter Pan.” or, The Boy who wouldn’t Grow Up.
## Composed by John Crook (1852–1922)

This project is dedicated to my son Martin:  
May his dreams be always bright.

This is a re-rendering of the score
as found at <http://hdl.handle.net/1802/24425>
and <https://books.google.com/books?id=J-wQAAAAYAAJ>,
using the LilyPond typesetting system,
and intended for eventual inclusion in the Mutopia Project:
<http://www.mutopiaproject.org/>
or on GitHub at <https://github.com/MutopiaProject/MutopiaProject>.

The version at U.R. Research has 70 pages of piano music;
the version at Google Books has only 40 pages
but includes the incidental music to the deleted scene
“The arrival of the beautiful mothers”,
not included in the longer version.

I have been told (on the LilyPond users mailing list)
that this score has the characteristics of a piano reduction.
The Theatre Communications Group’s _American Theater_, volume 20 (2003)
makes passing mention of an 80-page version of this score
which “contained much intrumen[tation]”.
I have not found any other reference to such an instrumental score;
any information on the subject would be much appreciated.

There have been very few recordings of this music.

In 1929 the J.H. Squire Celeste Octet recorded “selections”,
released by Columbia Gramophone as a two-disc set, catalog number 9768.
In 1940,
in the second year of the London Blitz preventing performances of the play,
there was something of a cast recording made,
with Jean Forbes-Robertson as Peter,
Dinah Sheridan as Wendy,
and Gordon Harker as Captain Hook;
the orchestra was conducted by Clifford Greenwood.
This was released as His Master’s Voice #9119.
Sepia Records [#1037](http://sepiarecords.com/sepia1037.html)
includes both those recordings.
(Thank you to Bruce Hanson,
author of _Peter Pan on Stage and Screen, 1904–2010_,
for the above information.)

There is also His Master’s Voice #2693,
performed by the London Palladium Orchestra
under the direction of Richard Crean.

## A Note on Copyright

The copyright status of _Peter Pan_ is somewhat odd;
see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy#Copyright_status>.
In particular, note that performance of the story within the U.K.
requires payment of royalties to the Great Ormond Street Hospital
as a continuation of J.M. Barrie’s 1929 gift of the copyright to GOSH.

I have confirmed with GOSH that John Crook’s score
was never included in this gift
(the copyright would have belonged not to Mr. Barrie
but to Mr. Crook or perhaps the Duke of York’s Theatre).
Since John Crook died in 1922,
the score is out of copyright at least in the U.S.A. and E.U.
